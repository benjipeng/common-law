As scientists and engineers, we've discovered that the systematic approach we use in solving complex technical problems shares remarkable similarities with legal analysis and precedent-based reasoning in common law. Both domains require meticulous attention to detail, logical progression of thought, and the ability to build upon established foundations while adapting to new circumstances.&#13;
&#13;
Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have revolutionized our ability to process and understand information. With advanced models like GPT-4, GPT-o1, and Google Gemini Pro demonstrating unprecedented capabilities in understanding context, analyzing complex documents, and drawing meaningful connections, we stand at the threshold of a new era in legal accessibility. &#13;
&#13;
We have been inspired us to create LexCrypt, a platform where we bridge the gap between traditional legal knowledge and modern technological capabilities.ã€‚</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://benjipeng.github.io/common-law/post/LexCrypt%20and%20why%20another%20website%20about%20US%20common%20law.html</guid><pubDate>Thu, 31 Oct 2024 20:36:47 +0000</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
