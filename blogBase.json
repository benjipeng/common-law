As scientists and engineers, we've discovered that the systematic approach we use in solving complex technical problems shares remarkable similarities with legal analysis and precedent-based reasoning in common law. Both domains require meticulous attention to detail, logical progression of thought, and the ability to build upon established foundations while adapting to new circumstances.\r\n\r\nRecent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have revolutionized our ability to process and understand information. With advanced models like GPT-4, GPT-o1, and Google Gemini Pro demonstrating unprecedented capabilities in understanding context, analyzing complex documents, and drawing meaningful connections, we stand at the threshold of a new era in legal accessibility. \r\n\r\nWe have been inspired us to create LexCrypt, a platform where we bridge the gap between traditional legal knowledge and modern technological capabilities.\u3002", "top": 0, "createdAt": 1730407007, "style": "", "script": "", "head": "", "ogImage": "https://github.githubassets.com/favicons/favicon.svg", "createdDate": "2024-11-01", "dateLabelColor": "#bc4c00"}}, "singeListJson": {}, "labelColorDict": {"bug": "#d73a4a", "documentation": "#0075ca", "duplicate": "#cfd3d7", "enhancement": "#a2eeef", "generic": "#4FC15B", "good first issue": "#7057ff", "help wanted": "#008672", "invalid": "#e4e669", "question": "#d876e3", "wontfix": "#ffffff"}, "displayTitle": "LexCrypt", "faviconUrl": "https://github.githubassets.com/favicons/favicon.svg", "ogImage": "https://github.githubassets.com/favicons/favicon.svg", "primerCSS": "<link href='https://mirrors.sustech.edu.cn/cdnjs/ajax/libs/Primer/21.0.7/primer.css' rel='stylesheet' />", "homeUrl": "https://benjipeng.github.io/common-law", "prevUrl": "disabled", "nextUrl": "disabled"}
